# Python

## Python is Everywhere

Python is a dynamically typed language, very similar to the JavaScript that you learned in your first three months at Nashville Software School. Any *nix based system (Unix, Linux, OSX, etc.) will have Python on it by default.

## Version 3

You will be learning version 3 of Python. While there is a tremendous amount of version 2 code that still exists in the world - and that you will likely work on in your career - the community is dedicated to migrating to 3 whenever possible.

> **Quick reference:** You can read the difference between Python 2 and Python 3 in this [PDF reference guide](http://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/imprint_downloads/informit/promotions/python/python2python3.pdf) from Pearson.
