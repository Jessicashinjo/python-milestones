# Representational State Transfer (REST)

REST is an architectural style that was detailed in Roy Fielding's dissertation (see link below). It describes the architecture of the World Wide Web, but can be applied to any long-running network based application that exposes resources to clients.

You will be presented with a [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Cs09OxTtce6Q4AJA1iwmcsJXNbxfyvW2B3TaegG67GQ/edit?usp=sharing) in class that will go over the core concepts of building an API using the REST constraints.
