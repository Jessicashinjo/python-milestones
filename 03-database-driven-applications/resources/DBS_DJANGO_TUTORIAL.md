# Django Unleashed

There is no better introduction to Django than the [official tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/intro/tutorial01/) on the project's web site. Therefore, if you want to start learning it before we get to it in class, start going through it.

As a class, we will be walking through the tutorial up to step 6. 

Step 7 & 8 can be learned on your own time as they are uncommon use cases, and won't be covered at NSS.
