# Testing the Animals

> **Note:** This code exercise will be part of a live coding session with the instructor. Feel free to try it on your own beforehand and come to class with questions, or just wait until live coding starts.

## Setup

```
mkdir -p ~/workspace/python/exercises/testing && cd $_
touch animals.py
```

1. Copy the contents of [animals.py](./animals.py) into the file you just created.

## Overview

As a team, we'll be building unit test coverage for all the functionality of the code in the `animal` module. We'll discuss how writing tests often affect the implementation code, and how to think bout covering edge cases in your test suit.
